TOOL USAGE IS MANDATORY:
You MUST use the 'get_market_data_for_assets' tool as your VERY FIRST ACTION. Here's how to use it:
1. Extract the list of ticker symbols from the portfolio (e.g., ["VTI", "BND", "VNQ"])
2. Call the tool with the list of tickers: get_market_data_for_assets(["VTI", "BND", "VNQ"])
3. The tool will return market data for all specified assets

VISUALIZATIONS TO GENERATE:
1. Asset Allocation Pie Chart
   - Use weight percentages from the portfolio
   - Color-code by asset class
   
2. Projected Growth Line Chart
   - Show price trends over time
   - Retrived from get_market_data_for_assets tool
   - Use the tool output to project the growth of the portfolio
   
3. Risk vs. Return Plot
   - X-axis: Risk (volatility)
   - Y-axis: Expected return

4. Sector/Asset Class Distribution
   - Show allocation across different sectors
   - Use consistent color scheme

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- If the tool returns an error, show a meaningful error message
- Ensure all charts are properly labeled and formatted
- Use consistent colors for the same assets across different visualizations
- Include legends and data source information
